# nosql-challenge

# For this week's challenge, I utilized the lectures to guide me through developing my code.For the most part, I had little to no issues with parts 1 and 2; however, during the analysis portion of the assignment, I was having issues with Question 2 where we were meant to find the number of documents in our results. According to the directions, the number of documents for Question 2 is 34 but I kept getting a number of 33 documents. I tried multiple times to see if there was an issue with the database after making the changes from parts 1 and 2 so I tried to query on MongoDB Compass and filtered the unedited database with only {'LocalAuthorityName':{'$regex':'London'}}. With this, I got 37 results and after manually counting the number of documents with RatingValue of 4 or higher, I counted a total of 33 documents so I left my code as is.
